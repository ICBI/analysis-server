# Pearson Correlation is parametric test for correlation.
# Pearson correlation analysis was used to describe associations between measurements. Pearson's 
# correlation coefficient is a measure of linear association. Two variables can be perfectly related, 
# however, if the relationship is not linear, Pearson's correlation coefficient is not an appropriate
# statistics for measuring their association. 

# Spearman's correlation is a non-parametric test for the strength of the relationship between pairs of variables
# Spearman Rank Correlation measures the correlation between two sequences of values. The two sequences 
# are ranked separately and the differences in rank are calculated at each position. The range of Spearman 
# Correlation is from -1 to 1. Spearman Correlation can detect certain linear and non-linear correlations. 
# However, Pearson Correlation may be more appropriate for finding linear correlations.

# cor(a): show correlations
# cor.test(a,b): test correlation

# correlation matrix
correlation <- function(x,y,method = c("pearson", "spearman")) {
r <- cor(x, y, use = "complete.obs", method = "pearson")
return(r)
}

# A graph for correlation analysis shows the dispersion of data points, with the variable of first 
# choice on the x axis, and second one on the y axis. For better utilization of this graphic function, 
# you need to specify each of the selected variables whether it is continuous type or enumerative type.
